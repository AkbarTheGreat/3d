Dice box for a standard set of 7 D&D Dice + a second d20.  Inspired as a remake of https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2964977 and therefore licensed the same, even as this reuses none of the assets from the original.

The salient difference between the two is a) by designing in OpenSCAD, it allows users more comfortable with that language to customize it however they'd like and b) I like the idea of each pocket being molded to the die it is intended to hold.

I also took inspiration from https://github.com/charmaur/PolyDiceGenerator/ as a method for generating dice shapes.  In general, this was a reference for how to use the excellent BOSL2 library, but when I wanted standard Chessex-sized die blanks for building the pockets to go into the box, this was what I used to see how other folks were making dice.
